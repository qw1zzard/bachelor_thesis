# Neural network methods in fraud detection applications

Welcome to this repository dedicated to my bachelor's thesis. I've authored two
reports, which you can find in PDF format:
- [report_1_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/report_1_ru.pdf)
- [report_2_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/report_2_ru.pdf)

These reports encompass a comprehensive literature review on the chosen topics.
Originally, my intention was to delve into the task of human pose estimation,
but I later shifted my focus to fraud detection. For in-depth insights, feel
free to explore the reports.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I aim for thoroughness in
all aspects of my work.
