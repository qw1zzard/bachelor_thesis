# Neural network methods in fraud detection applications

Welcome to the repository dedicated to my Bachelor's thesis! I have authored two reports, which you can find in PDF format:

- [report_1_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/report_1_ru.pdf)
- [report_2_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/report_2_ru.pdf)

Following these, I wrote the thesis itself:

- [bachelor_thesis_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/bachelor_thesis_ru.pdf)

These reports provide a comprehensive literature review on the chosen topics. Initially, I intended to explore the problem of human pose estimation, but later shifted my focus to fraud detection. For a more in-depth understanding, feel free to explore these reports.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I strive for thoroughness in all aspects of my work.
