# 3D Human Pose Estimation

This repository is dedicated to my bachelor's thesis. Currently, I've completed
the first report, available as a PDF file [report_1_ru.pdf](https://github.com/qw1zzard/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/report_1_ru.pdf).
It encompasses a comprehensive literature review on the subject. Check this out
for detailed insights.

Feel free to reach out with any questions about this topic. I aim to be
meticulous in all aspects of my work.
